## Quick Start
`yarn`
`yarn start`

## Summary
Everything inside of this folder is what I have created from scratch! I hope you find inspiration from my ideas within here. If you have any questions, please feel free to dm me on twitter @DeGatchi. 

## Theory
- Drip Button: When the user clicks on the default button (that has no keyframe animations) it will switch the button to the styled button with the `spinDownOn` animation selected. After the tx is complete, the button will be switched to the `spinDownOff` animation (the user will be able to click the button mid animation so there are no unnecessary delays - the tx is complete, so why not allow them?), then back to the original.
- Info Cards: Hovering over the card makes a drip come down while the card pops out a bit; cursor off the card begins the return of the drip

## Todo

Connected Wallet:
- Add custom token when connected & add token symbol like SUSHISWAP when not connected
