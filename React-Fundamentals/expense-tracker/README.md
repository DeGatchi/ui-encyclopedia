### Quick Start
`yarn` - downloads dependencies.

`yarn start` - launches the React App locally.

### Notes
- A component in React is just a Javacript function.
- Upper case character elements are made from the developer, whereas lower case character elements are native to React.
- This code snippet: `someArray.map((element) => <p>{element}</p>)` transforms the array (element) into a new array full of JSX elements (which can be output by React)
